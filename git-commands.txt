four different areas where your code resides :-
1. local working directory (your play ground)
2. staging area (its a checkpoint to add all the new changes/files etc using command - git add .)
3. local repo (after adding your changes to stage, you will commit the changes to your local branch with a short msg and commmand - git commit)
4. remote branch (once you commit and want to share your changes, you will push the changes to remote)

GIT Commands :
1. git version : to check version of git on your system
2. git config --global --list : to check the current user and id
3. git status : to check what are different changes you have made so far but not yet added or commited
4. git add . : to add all the new changes in one go to you local working branch 
5. git add <file_name> : to add a specific file to your local working branch 
6. git status : to check again if all the required changes are added or not
7. git commit : to commit all the changes to your local working branch with a msg
8. git branch : to check which branch you are on currently and making changes
9. git checkout -b <branch-name> : to make a new branch in your local once you clone remote branch, you need to first make a new local branch and then start working its a good practice
10. git switch <branch-name> : to switch between branches 
11. git commit -m "commit msg" : to commit changes with a short msg
